            Large Language Models (LLMs) have seen a surge in popularity due to their impressive results in natural language processing tasks,
            but there are still challenges to be addressed. Prompting in the question
            is a solution for some of them. Here, we present PIQARD, an
            open-source Python library that allows researchers to experiment with
            prompting techniques and information retrieval and combine them with
            LLMs. This library includes pre-implemented components and also allows users to integrate their own methods.

            a pattern containing instructions on the task along with examples of its solution. One of the basic prompt template
            is shown below:

<pre><code>Answer the question.
  Q: What is the capital of Germany?

            and briefly describe the task. The second part is the <span class="text-third-color">list of examples</span>, which is a pair of question and answer. 
            The last example is left blank, so that the LLM can fill it with the answer to the question. Below we present a few examples of
            more complex prompts, which are also implemented in PIQARD.

Observation: Pavel Samuilovich Urysohn (February 3, 1898 - August 17, 1924) was a Soviet mathematician who is best known for his contributions in dimension theory.
Thought 2: Pavel Urysohn is a mathematician. I need to search Leonid Levin next and find its type of work.
Action 2: Search[Leonid Levin]
Observation: Leonid Anatolievich Levin is a Soviet-American mathematician and computer scientist.
Thought 3: Leonid Levin is a mathematician and computer scientist. So Pavel Urysohn and Leonid Levin have the same type of work.

For each input, determine if the answerer will need to access the internet to respond.
Statements or question of opinion do not require the internet, factual question or commands might.
In general, simple factual questions whose answers do not change over time can be answered without the internet access.
Questions that refer to current events, news, sports, websites that change frequently, etc. will require the internet access.
Questions that refer highly specific events that the answer may not have memorized also require the internet access.
If they do not need to access the internet, the answerer will respond with "No". If they do, rephrase the question in the form of search command.
